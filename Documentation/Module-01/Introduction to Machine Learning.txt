Machine Learning: Field of Study that gives Computer the ability to learn without being explicitly Programmed.
by Arthur Samuel(1959)
Python Libraries for Machine Learning like Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit Learn 
 

Most of the tasks that need to be done in a Machine Learning Pipeline are -

↓
Train/Test Split 
↓
Algorithm Setup(Defining the Algorithm)
↓
Model Fitting 
↓
Prediction 
↓
Evaluation
↓
Model Export
